5.**Implementation Details**  


5.1 **Technical Stack (Proposed)**  


5.2 **API Integration Strategy**  
The goal is to use **API Ninjas** for the mortgage payments. API Ninjas provides detailed mortgage payment information as well as calculate monthly payments, anual payments or interest. We will also use **CalcX** for the autoloan payments. Calcx via github/rapidAPI will be used to return the numbers for our complex buttons and work perfectly with the GUI.
